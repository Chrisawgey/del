      "title": "Who We Are",
      "content": "The Deli of Springfield was founded on December 7th, 2023. The creation of the name came from the realization that every surrounding town has a food place named after the town, and that's exactly what was missing in Springfield, NJ. We bring our own recipes for people to try, and our mission is to serve freshness and quality. Most importantly, our secret that sets us apart from everyone else is that we serve everything with love and passion. We're proud to be a family-run business, and we look forward to continuing to serve Springfield and the surrounding towns for many years to come."

Opening The Deli of Springfield has always been a dream of mine. I've helped others open their own deli/bagel shops in Union County, and that motivated me to take a leap of faith. At The Deli of Springfield, we are committed to serving the freshest and highest-quality food, always treating our customers like family and making them feel at home."
